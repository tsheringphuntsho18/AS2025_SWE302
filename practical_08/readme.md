# Practical_08 Report: GUI Testing with Cypress

## Overview
This practical focuses on automated testing of web applications using **Cypress** for GUI (end-to-end) testing. The objective is to gain hands-on experience in writing, organizing, and executing tests to ensure application reliability and performance.

## Objectives
- Learn the basics of Cypress for end-to-end GUI testing.
- Implement and organize Cypress tests for various user interactions and scenarios.
- Use fixtures and custom commands in Cypress to enhance test maintainability.
- Mock and validate API responses in Cypress.
- Apply the Page Object Model for scalable test code.
- Use k6 to perform API performance and load testing.
- Analyze test results and understand their significance in software quality assurance.






## Challenges Faced
- Understanding and implementing advanced Cypress features like API mocking and custom commands.
- Organizing tests for scalability and maintainability.
- Interpreting k6 performance metrics and identifying bottlenecks.

## Conclusion
This practical provided valuable experience in automated testing using Cypress and k6. It reinforced the importance of both functional and performance testing in modern web development, and demonstrated best practices for organizing and maintaining test code.
