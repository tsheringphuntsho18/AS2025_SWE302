# Practical_07 Report: Performance Testing with k6

## Overview 
In this practical session, we focus on performance testing of a given system (code under performance-testing). Performance testing falls under the non-functional testing domain (alongside reliability, scalability, maintainability, etc). It aims to validate how the system behaves under load, its responsiveness, stability, throughput, and resource usage.

## Conclusion 
In summary, this practical validated the performance behaviour of the system under varying loads. It demonstrated that while the system handles typical loads satisfactorily, beyond a certain concurrency the performance degrades, indicating a capacity limit. Further optimisation or scaling would be required for higher target loads. Performance testing thus plays a crucial role in understanding system limits and ensuring service levels.
